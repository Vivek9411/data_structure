#merge short algo 

merge short is the shorting technique based on divide and concquer
In which we divide a larger problen into many smaller problems which are then solved resulting in many solved problems which are then combined to hive the solution of the larger problem

#######---algo-----------------------------------##
//algo of merge short can be divided into three parts 
1-> divide -> means partitioning the n-element array to be sorted into two sub-arrays of n/2 elements
2-> Conquer means sorting the two sub-arrays recursively using merge sort.
3-> Combine means merging the two sorted sub-arrays of size n/2 to produce the sorted array of n
    elements.
