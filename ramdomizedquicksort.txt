Randomized QuickSort is a variant of the QuickSort algorithm that uses a randomly generated pivot to partition the array. 
This technique improves the time complexity of the sorting algorithm. 



rand() function is an inbuilt function in C++ STL, which is defined in header file <cstdlib>. rand() is used to generate a series of random numbers. 
The random number is generated by using an algorithm that gives a series of non-related numbers whenever this function is called. 
The rand() function is used in C++ to generate random numbers in the range [0, RAND_MAX).

Parameters of rand()
This function does not take any parameters.
                                                                            
Return Value of rand()
rand() returns a pseudo-random number in the range of [0, RAND_MAX).



srand()
srand() function is an inbuilt function in C++ STL,  which is defined in <cstdlib> header file. srand() is used to initialize random number generators. 
The srand() function sets the starting point for producing a series of pseudo-random integers. 
If srand() is not called, the rand() seed is set as if srand(1) were called at the program start. Any other value for seed sets the generator to a different starting point.
